After staring at the giant red error for awhile - I finally realized I was thinking to literally when it said showGlobal is not defined. At first I thought I needed to give it some sort of value, but I eventually realized I was that was not the case. I looked at the sources tab in dev tools on where the error was and realized it was just missing the 's' at the end of it. It was an ahhh ha type moment.
